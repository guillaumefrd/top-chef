# TOP CHEF

> Eat well and cheaper than usually

## Objective

**Get the current deals for all the France located Michelin starred restaurants.**

## Good to know

**If you want to see directly the result, just click [here](https://guillaumefrd.github.io/top-chef/top-chef-app/build/).**

Otherwise, you can visit the repository to explore my solution. 

**The two folders you should visit are:**

1. **[src](https://github.com/guillaumefrd/top-chef/tree/master/src)**: the **server-side** work, including **web scraping** and **API calls**. This is the part where I get all the starred restaurants from Michelin and the deals from LaFourchette *(more information about it on the README inside the folder)*.
2. **[top-chef-app](https://github.com/guillaumefrd/top-chef/tree/master/top-chef-app)**: the **React** application. This is the part where I display the results on a web page *(more information about it on the README inside the folder)*.
